## Currently working on..
- 📶RFID-Based Smart Inventory Tracker
  ESP32-based system using RFID tags to track items in real time with a companion app.
  Goal is to completely eliminate the use of paper shopping lists!
  App will allow you to insert a shopping list and as you scan items it will delete it and mark your list as complete.

## 📘 Currently Learning
- 🔧 More **C++** for Embedded Development
- ⏱ **RTOS concepts** (task scheduling, semaphores, mutexes)
- 🔐 IoT Security & BLE Communication
